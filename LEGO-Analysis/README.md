# Analysis of LEGO Dataset with Pandas

## Introduction
Today we'll dive deep into a dataset all about LEGO. From the dataset we can ask whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the LEGO company, their product offering, and which LEGO set ultimately rules them all:

* What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
* How did the LEGO company start out? In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
* Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it one of LEGO's own themes like Ninjago or a theme they licensed liked Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?
* When did the LEGO company really expand its product offering? Can we spot a change in the company strategy based on how many themes and sets did it released year-on-year?
* Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

## Learning Points & Summary
Today we looked at how to:

* use HTML Markdown in Notebooks, such as section headings # and how to embed images with the `<img>` tag.

* combine the `groupby()` and `count()` functions to aggregate data

* use the `.value_counts()` function

* slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., df[:-2] or df[:10]

* use the `.agg()` function to run an operation on a particular column

* `rename()` columns of DataFrames

* create a line chart with two separate axes to visualise data that have different scales.

* create a scatter plot in Matplotlib

* work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys

* `.merge()` DataFrames along a particular column

* create a bar chart with Matplotlib
